## Week 6: June 19 - June 23

### What I worked on

My 6th week was inclined towards rounding up with the SMS Without Borders Backend Repository docs, though as per my internship timeline, it should be the last week of documentation. However due to some stumbles, and blocks encountered, I wasn't able to complete the documentation. The best I could do was to learn from my mistakes, and how to not make them again, and keep pushing, rather than crying over spilled milk. For that reason I'll be carrying it over to my next goals list on the timeline, working a little overtime if need be. I did the following this week:

- Continued documenting the SWOB Backend
- Through inspecting the backend, frontend and custom third party platforms codebases, my understanding of the projects and data flow improved significantly.

### What I learned

Through completing these tasks, I learned the following:

- How data flows more clearly
- How to structure big projects and practice modularity
- Python best practices
- Developer best practices
- More on authentication and authorization
- More on the Peewee ORM

### Challenges I faced

- **Late reviews**: This isn't fully a challenge, just a drawback. Cause there are times documentation I'm writing are dependent on earlier versions or structures, as such, proceeded to document a package for example with a wrong structure or format or poor content quality could be a potential waste of time, as one would have to redo the entire work after appropriate review. As such, carrying on without reviews was very bewildering.

### How I overcame them

- Since I couldn't lay back waiting for a review, I did the best I could, based on past reviews and lessons learnt, hoping they prove effective. What's life without risk? Besides, time might be wasted, but not knowledge, and to some degree, it's worth a shot.

### Next steps

Moving forward,

- I plan on fine-tuning any area that lacks for the SWOB Backend docs and for the SWOB third party platforms docs.
