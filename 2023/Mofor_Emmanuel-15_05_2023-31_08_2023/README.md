## About Me

Additionally, please share what you hope to gain from this internship and how you plan to contribute to the team. -->
I am Mofor Emmanuel, a computer engineering student at The University of Bamenda. I am passionate about building software that people use daily, software that eases lives, and one that causes an impact. I love working on and contributing to open-source software, building with experienced developers, and expanding my skills-set daily.

I have worked (interned; in some cases) as a Frontend, Backend & Fullstack developer and Software Engineer for startups, agencies & organizations, and as a freelancer.
Throughout my journey, as much as I have gathered some experience in the mentioned fields, I continually seek to improve my skills and become a better developer by the day.

I am currently an intern at Afkanerd Technologies and one of the reasons I got interested in pursuing an internship there is because they have this ideology of **"Coding for the people"**; and the moment I saw this, it took me to this realm where you could say it's analogous to "love at first sight" - I don't believe in that by the way; Also, they want to bring about change, and what's fascinating is that they don't just preach on change or spill cliche gibberish, they inspire this change and drive development by leading the way. Reading their mission statement was like listening to one of those Optimus Prime's speeches at the end of every Transformers movie.
I was also interested in the organization cause of how they implement complex systems, carry out their operations, plan, structure, and build software. Working here is challenging, but I had to leave my comfort zone and grow, so here I am, embracing every challenge like a career embryo.

I am confident that during the internship, I'll learn how to plan and build even bigger and more complex systems, various industry standards, methodologies, and implementations, collaborate with larger teams, improve on technical, soft, and interpersonal skills, and so much more. In summary, I will be "production-ready."

I plan on contributing to some of the projects, especially SMSWithoutBorders, an application for offline communication, which is a revolutionary miracle to people in areas of poor or no internet connection - imaging sending Gmail emails or Twitter tweets, or Telegram messages with SMS, simply pure ingenuity.
I look forward to researching and expanding the list of currently supported platforms and improving existing solutions where need be; that way, we reach out to more people and solve their communication problems. After all, we code for the people.
I am delighted to be part of the team; looking forward to a great experience here at Afkanerd.
