## Week 14: August 14 - August 18

### What I worked on

Following the delay in requesting for elevated scope permissions from Yahoo and Discord, I had to carry on with work on another platform, Slack.

I did the following this week:

- Started my research and overview of the Slack platform, terminologies and common stuff related to the ecosystem
- Studied a previous intern's work (Ida Delphine), as well as what part of her code or idea I could use
- Started implementing the Slack OAuth2 protocol and testing message sending techniques

### What I learned

Through completing these tasks, I learned the following:

- An overview of how Slack works
- How to implement Slack OAuth2 protocol
- How to send messages on behalf of users

### Challenges I faced

Though I won't call it a challenge, the OAuth flow is a little weird, specially using the slack SDK, I didn't want to rush into things for the purpose of doing work, as I saw this as an opportunity to learn something different from the other workflows I've worked with and implemented.

### How I overcame them

Doesn't apply

### Next steps

Moving forward,

- I plan on understanding better how Telegram message sending was implemented, in terms of messages, channels and groups, as well as how I can mimic that for slack, or the idea at least.
