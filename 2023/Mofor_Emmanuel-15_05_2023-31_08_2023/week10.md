## Week 10: July 17 - July 21

### What I worked on

Permit me to do more of journaling than reporting progress.
It's my 10th week at Afkanerd, and so far it's been rewarding, not just code-related or software-dev-related, but personalitywise;

This week, has been the worst week so far during my internship, in the sense that, the other weeks were difficult, challenging; But this one? it was hot, so hot it burns (get it? burnout?), yeah. It was terrible.

So I'm actually writing this at the start of week 11, cause I didn't have any progress to report (so I thought), it was that bad.

But this Monday morning, while doing some chores, I kept reflecting on last week, and was there really no progress?, then it dawned on me.

In my opinion, how we respond to failure, determines if we're ready for success. Honestly, I wasn't, till this morning anyways. It was this morning some of the things my mentor used to tell me began making perfect sense.

I asked myself:

- what is progress?
- why do we fail?
- what do we do when we fail?
- what would my mentor do?

and his words came alive. Ahh, btw, I was tired of the whole impostor syndrome thing; had too much of it the whole week that it became pointless - and my brain was like "Dude, snap out of it, WTH!", and I was like yeah, you're right!. I had an amazing weekend btw ðŸ˜‚ - I've never been so disengaged from work (and looking forward so eagerly to mount my workstation at the start of the week) - the burnout was that bad.

Etymologically speaking, progress is an advancement through a series of events, or points in time; a development; to improve; to become better.

The question now is, what is your pivotal reference?, of what are we advancing from?

- Writing more code?
- Making more commits?
- Opening more PRs?

My pivot has always been work-related, I know I've made progress when I add commits, or when I write more code, and stuff like that. How wrong I was.

I have seen people make pointless commits, write needless unproductive code, and open PRs worth being ignored; According to my definition, they have progressed, but did they really make any advancement?, any improvement?, Nay!.

Then I recalled my mentor who usually tells me it's not always about work, then I had to look back into my previous week.

Sure I didn't make any commits, I wrote code though, a lot of code, a lot of approaches taken, but were futile. I did progress, because I know what it means to fail, but more importantly, I've learnt how to brace failure, and I know I've failed the day I give up.

My mentor used to tell me not to cry over spilled milk ðŸ˜‚, but it was always hard you know, especially if you invested so much time and resources to have that milk. Nevertheless, the more I cry over the milk, the more I delay trying to get another milk.

It's this morning that the words came alive to me;

Look at this; Sure, I failed trying to implement mail sending with Yahoo. (Thanks btw Yahoo!, I now get why there's an exclamation mark after Yahoo - Yahoo "na shock" ðŸ˜‚) - anyways, I'm still a young developer and learning, it's alright to not get everything right the first time. Even Christ fell 3 times, but what'd he do? he woke up, took his cross, and rode on, how hard it was.

I failed with ..., scratch that, let me take it over again; I didn't succeed with the mail sending logic. Yahoo mail sending after authentication with OAuth2 is very very bewildering - ofcourse with SMPT authentication, it's so much easier. Yahoo is not like GMail or Twitter that have client libraries that aid developers and stuff like that, they have little or no documentation (I will be reaching out to the team btw). Despite that, I could have gone ahead to do some pending work on documentation or research on Discord or probably another platform in the mean time, but nay, just couldn't get over the fact that I'm not getting a solution, I got a burnout, but kept grinding though, till my burnout was burnt out ðŸ˜‚, it was crazy. In the end, I didn't get a solution, neither did I get to do other work; What a double loss.

This was how the impostor syndrome feeling became pointless - I mean I tried, I did what I could; my plans are always so easier in my head - but we don't know the future, or how things might turn out, so we should brace for the worst, but hope for the best. Just cause I made plans doesn't mean the universe will be like "Oh he's made plans, let's readjust so everything goes as he planned". I have accepted that there'll be unforseen circumstances, there'll be drawbacks, failures. But when they come, what do you do?
Planning is all about having a guided workflow, for optimum output ofcourse.

I didn't even reach out to my mentor cause I felt like I would be bothering him and stuff like that, I told him to let me have it, I really wanted to do this, kept questioning if I was up to the task, if he'd be disappointed, what if I'm a nuissance, what if I'm like a bug in his code?, but guess what? he's a good debugger ðŸ˜‚.

I mean, people face these a alot in the industry. My mentor always tells me, it's about me, it's about my experiences, what I learn. Did I ever understand that? well not so much, till today though.
I have always tried to do things right, to impress him, to not let him down or stuff like that, while that is awesome, am I learning?. It baffled me why it never mattered to him, and what he wanted was that I learn, he kept reminding me it's about me, not him - ah!, what a great man, I'm truly priviledged.

Well, to be honest, I wasn't learning so much, cause it was like I was doing it for him, not me?. But I'm confident henceforth, I'll be learning fully, I'll try my best to, for me!.

And if this isn't progress to you, then quit whatever you're doing, please!, you're toxic.

I have progressed, just not work-related.
But I feel like someone ready for success you know, cause I'm ready to brace failure. Took me my entire life + 10 weeks at Afkanerd for this to dawn on me, very interesting, very very interesting.

So yes, my experience so far at Afkanerd is priceless!!!!!.

I did the following this week:

### What I learned

- It's okay to not get everything right
- It's okay to fail
- Don't cry over spilled milk (figuratively and literally)
- Reach out for help whenever, no matter how you feel about it, let the person you're reaching out for help decide how they'll feel about it, not you deciding for them
- It's not always going to be work-related, there's more to learn than just writing code
- Progress is not defined based on a work-related point of view
- We fail the minute we stop trying
- Avoid burnouts, at all cost - when experiencing one, take a break
- Include a margin for the unforseen when planning - while being optimistic, be realistic also

### Challenges I faced

- **Implementing mail sending with Yahoo:** Last week, my challenge was implementing token revocation. It was a dead end, as the Yahoo team hadn't implemented the mechanism themselves.
  This week, it's implementing mail sending after authenticating a user. This was just back and forth, and circular, as I did so much search and sought for examples or possible implementations, to the point that the search result links that were returned had the color of visited links. It was that bad. If ChatGPT was a person, I would've gotten it well beaten for the so many dead ends it lead me to ðŸ˜‚. It tried it's best though. We had a tough time really!.

### How I overcame them

- I didn't

### Next steps

Moving forward,

- I plan on escalating the challenge faced to my mentor, then in the mean time, I'll look into the pending documentation work, and research on Discord or Slack or any platform suitable to add to SWOB, maybe Thread even, we keep grinding!.
