## Week 11: July 24 - July 28

### What I worked on

Week 11 has been a productive week so far. No burnouts, no imposter syndrome, none of those things, just an awesome week!

I did the following this week:

- Handled the changes my mentor requested regarding the SWOB Backend documentation
- Started researching on Discord platform
- Started Discord OAuth protocol implementation
- Gathered tips (best practices) on how to put my blog posts out there (tips on creating engaging social media posts, with CTAs that lead to my blog)

### What I learned

Through completing these tasks, I learned the following:

- When documenting code, [specifically, adding code examples in documentation], it is important to:

  - Not go beyond the context of the concerned method, class, function, or object we are documenting
  - Use self explanatory and reflective variables and placeholder values in code examples

- Discord is still in active service, and though popular among gamers and gaming communities due to its features and ease of use, it is not limited to that, as many non-gaming communities, such as technology enthusiasts, hobbyist groups, study groups, and professional organizations, also utilize Discord for communication and collaboration
- Discord provides OAuth 2.0 support, which allows third-party applications and services to integrate with Discord and access certain user data and functionalities based on the permissions granted by the users
- It's not so easy to overcome **"self-promotion anxiety/fear"** (a new word I learnt). People experiencing self-promotion anxiety may feel uncomfortable or apprehensive about showcasing their talents or accomplishments, often due to a fear of judgment, criticism, or rejection from others. It can manifest in various ways, such as reluctance to share achievements, avoiding networking opportunities, or feeling overwhelmed by the idea of building an online presence.

### Challenges I faced

- **Nothing tough this week, Yayy!:** I had some confusions though, not sure to call them challenges

### How I overcame them

- My mentor clarified them

### Next steps

Moving forward,

- I plan on completing the implementation of Discord OAuth protocol, researching further on Discord and get started with media sending, while waiting on my mentor's response pertaining to Yahoo! mail sending.
