## Week 4: June 5 - June 9

### What I worked on

My fourth week at Afkanerd Technologies was focused on documenting the SMS WIthout Borders Backend Repository. I accomplished the following:

<!-- - Attended the weekly standup meeting and got feedback from my previous week's work. -->
- Researched on code documentation structures
- Explored python documentation generators
- Started documenting the SWOB Backend models with structural inspiration from PDoc

### What I learned

Through completing these tasks, I learned the following:

- Documentation isn't as easy as I thought
- Never look down on documenters as most developers do
- Never overlook documentation
- How to structure code documentation, and what to expect from a documentation

### Challenges I faced

- **Rejected attempts**: Absurd as it may sound, it was a challenge getting past rejection. It wasn't huge, but it's kind of demotivating when you spend time working on something, only for you to get a feedback to redo it again. It doesn't just get in the way of your plans, but to some level it hurts. However, we should opt for the best, and want to always learn and improve our skills, no matter how many times we try and fail, that's a consoling factor - we keep grinding, grit all the way.

- **Getting the documentation structure right**

### How I overcame them

- About the rejection, it's just the beginning. I guess more to come. So the best thing I can do is request reviews for samples or prototypes before making big changes. What I noticed about this is that with every rejection comes a better version of you, you learn something new, big or small, if only you handle the rejection positively, that is. I am positive I can now write a documentation with or without a docs generator.
- For the documentation structure, after about 4 different attempts, my mentor directed me to follow a suitable structure, he went ahead to give me a sample, and why it was good. He explained further that documentation should always outline programmatic properties, be clear and straight to the point.

### Next steps

Moving forward,

- I plan on completing the documentation for the backend and third party platforms projects, now that I got an approved structure.
