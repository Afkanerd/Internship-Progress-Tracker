## Week 7: June 26 - June 30

### What I worked on

The experience so far truly is rewarding, I'm gaining a lot on the aspect of technical writing. I'm also excited to have a taste of how the industry is like, and I'm making the most of every problem or difficulty I face, negative emotions I feel, or the fact that there are things I can't control.

That said, week 7 at Afkanerd is the beginning of the second part of the second phase of my internship journey. The week was inclined heavily on familiarizing myself with the SWOB Custom Third Party Platforms data flow, researching on possible platforms that integrate aptly into the SWOB ecosystem, as well as researching on my upcoming blog post on Open-Source Contributions and its impact.

I did the following this week:

- Inspected the SWOB Custom Third Party Platforms repository
- Started researching on other platforms to add to the SWOB Platforms list
- Started researching on Open-Source contributions and its impacts

### What I learned

Through completing these tasks, I learned the following:

- It's abashing how I dove into open source with limited knowledge of it. But after commencing my research on it, I did learn a lot I didn't know, I truly was in awe.

### Challenges I faced

- **Finding Platforms**: Finding possible platforms that fit aptly into the SWOB ecosystem isn't as easy as I thought, based on filters like:

  - OAuth protocol compatibility
  - Actively in use, popular and not dying any time soon
  - Can integrate into a centralized solution for the storage of auth tokens and/or sessions
  - Compatibility with the current SWOB TPP custom logic and methods implementation that provides a layer of abstraction for use in the SWOB Backend

The platforms I had in mind from my research were rejected as they didn't fit aptly.

### How I overcame them

- Still searching

### Next steps

Moving forward,

- I plan on completing my blog post and having atleast one platform that can be added to the SWOB platforms list
