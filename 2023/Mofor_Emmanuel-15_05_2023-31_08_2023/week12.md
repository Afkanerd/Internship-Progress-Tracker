## Week 12: July 31 - August 4

### What I worked on

It's the last month of my internship period already, and whilst it's a little sad, I'm looking forward to making the most out of the time I have left, and ofcourse - keeping in touch, open-source doesn't end. Truly, reflecting on my time here, I've been open to a lot of processes, workflows, ideas, patterns and resources I had no idea about. I'm so grateful for the opportunity

I did the following this week:

- Researched on Git and GitHub, core concepts, benefits, advanced workflows, IDE integrations, common errors and learning resources
- Published my blog post on [Mastering Git and GitHub](https://moforemmanuel.github.io/blog/mastering-git-and-github/)
- Getting familiar the discord ecosystem
- Further research on Discord OAuth2 protocol
- Implementation of Discord OAuth2 protocol

### What I learned

Through completing these tasks, I learned the following:

- How advanced workflows like GitFlow and feature branches work
- How Discord works

### Challenges I faced

- **Getting acquainted with Discord:** For a platform I've never used, it sure is hectic wrapping my head around it's architecture.

- **Balancing blog content:** Finding the balance between Advancing the skills of Git & GitHub users and introducing the concepts to newbies sure was a problem.

### How I overcame them

- I tried to have a top-level view of Discord, and how it works. That way, it'll not be too complicated when I try understanding the underlying architecture.

### Next steps

Moving forward,

- I plan on fine-tuning the implementation of Discord OAuth2 protocol, getting acquainted even more with the platform, and going about media sending.
