## Week 16: August 28 - September 1

### What I worked on

I was able to merge the two auth methods provided by slack (OpenIDConnect Auth and App Installation Auth), by so doing, avoided the need to implement auth twice, or request user auth twice.
I was also able to implement simple message sending

I did the following this week:

- Researched on Time Management Strategies for developers
- Wrote a blog post on [Time Management Strategies for Developers](https://moforemmanuel.github.io/blog/time-management-strategies-for-developers/)
- Implemented a merge of Authorization and the OpenIDConnect Authorization with Slack
- Researched on message sending using Slack API's chat.postMessage
- Implemented simple message sending with Slack

### What I learned

Through completing these tasks, I learned the following:

- How to merge the two methods of authorization/authentication
- How to implement Slack message sending
- Time management strategies for developers

### Challenges I faced

nothing technical

### How I overcame them

doesn't apply

### Next steps

Moving forward,

- It's technically the end of the internship, but I look forwarding to staying in touch and make those useful commits and contributions. Open Source doesn't end after all - We code for the people
