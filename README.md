# Internship Progress Tracker

Welcome to the Internship Progress Tracker for Afkanerd Technologies! This repository is designed to help interns keep track of their progress during their internship. 

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
├── year1
│   ├── intern1_name-start_date-end_date
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── week1.md
│   │   ├── week2.md
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── intern2_name-start_date-end_date
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── week1.md
│   │   ├── week2.md
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
├── year2
│   ├── intern1_name-start_date-end_date
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── week1.md
│   │   ├── week2.md
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── intern2_name-start_date-end_date
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── week1.md
│   │   ├── week2.md
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

The top-level directories are named according to the year of the internship. Inside each year's directory, there is a folder for each intern who participated in the program that year. The name of the folder is in the format `intern_name-start_date-end_date`, where `intern_name` is the name of the intern, and `start_date` and `end_date` are the start and end dates of their internship, respectively.

Inside each intern's folder, there is a `README.md` file that serves as the table of contents for that intern's progress updates. The `README.md` file links to other markdown files named according to weeks (`week1.md`, `week2.md`, etc.), which contain the progress updates for that week.
